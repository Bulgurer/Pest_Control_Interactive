$n: You get up, look around the laboratory and somehow know what things are. 
That giant whirlwind of steel covering the only space small enough 
to build a new home is called a fan, 
and the ferocious beast with dagger teeth that nearly killed you before is called a $c.

$n: Thoughts are weird, aren't they? Well, don't worry about that part. 
You walk over to the large water depository in your cell; its tap is slowly dripping, 
and you take some sips. On the water's surface, you see a fuzzy, grey-haired, 
beady-eyed little creature that you know is called a rat. It's you. 
You are a rat. A lab rat, to be specific, and you know that's a bad thing.

$n: The door opens. 
A man in a bright, colourful flower suit with slicked-back black hair and a pencil moustache walks in 
and starts inspecting each piece of equipment in the room with exquisite care, 
as if each were his favourite thing in the world. The $m turns to look at you. 
At first, just a bored glance; a double take; a triple take; and then he stops and focuses on you, 
standing in the center of your cage curiously looking at him. 
Your hair inexplicably stands on end and your stomach turns with his every move.

You walk over to where it should be, feeling around for the metal cage.
You find it!

It seems like you could move this handle part over to the right, and the cage would be unlocked.
